# Ball and Pipe Control System
MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system. The system is made of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan on the bottom and height measured by a time of flight sensor on top. The objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude.

# PID Controller with Genetic Algorithm

# 1) Project Description (EXPLAIN SCOPE OF PROJECT)
## What your application does
Our group's Ball & Pipe Controller utilizes a PID controller with a genetic Algorithm tuner to get the ball to reach any specified steady state location in the tube in the fastest time possible.

# 3) WALK THROUGH HOW TO USE CODE
## How to Install & Run the Project: What are the required dependancies? (MATLAB, Toolkits, Ball & pipe system, connection testing setup using Putty)
The Ball & Pipe system is coded using [MATLAB](https://matlab.mathworks.com), which can be downloaded off their website.  
The system uses the following MATLAB Toolkits:
